\section*{Objective}

Measure the wavelength of a microwave by creating a standing wave and demonstrate Snell's law using a prism mold.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Standing waves}

A standing wave is a wave whose energy density at every point remains constant, or a wave that does not propagate.
The points at which the energy density is zero are called the nodes of the wave, and the points where the energy
density is a maximum are called the antinodes.

A standing wave is generated by resonance when a traveling plane wave of wavelength $\lambda$ reflects back on itself
from a wall that is some integer multiple of $\lambda/2$ away from the source and interferes with itself. The horns
of the microwave receiver reflect some radiation, so the transmitter and receiver can be placed facing each other at
a distance $n\lambda/2$ apart (for any natural number $n$) to create a standing wave. When this happens, the intensity
reading will be at a maximum.

\subsection{Refraction}

An electromagnetic wave is refracted, or bent, when it passes from one medium to another.

\section{Procedures and Results}

\subsection{Standing waves}

We set up the microwave system so that the transmitter and receiver diodes were approximately 70 cm and then slid them
a few centimeters farther apart to get a maximum intensity reading. Then, we slid them farther apart, counting the
times that the intensity reading hit a local minimum, stopping at a local maximum. We recorded the initial and final
positions of the units and the number of minima passed.
